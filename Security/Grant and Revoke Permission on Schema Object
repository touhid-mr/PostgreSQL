##Create a read-only user in PostgreSQL
##1. To create a new user in PostgreSQL:

CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';

##2. GRANT the CONNECT access:

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name TO username;
##3. Then GRANT USAGE on schema:

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
##4. GRANT SELECT

Grant SELECT for a specific table:
GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO username;

Grant SELECT for multiple tables:
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;

If you want to grant access to the new table in the future automatically, you have to alter default:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA schema_name
GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO username;



DROP USER dev_tom


REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres FROM dev_tom
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA tom   FROM  dev_tom;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES  ON SCHEMA tom     FROM dev_tom ;  
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA tom   FROM dev_tom;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA tom FROM dev_tom;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA tom FROM dev_tom;

-- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA tom TO dev_tom;
